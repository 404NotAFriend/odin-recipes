    <p>Arroz de Cabidela, also known as "Blood Rice," is a traditional Portuguese dish made with chicken or rabbit and rice, cooked with the animal's blood to give it a rich and distinctive flavor. It's a hearty and flavorful dish often enjoyed during special occasions.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken or rabbit, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>2 cups of rice</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 cup of red wine</li>
        <li>1 cup of chicken or rabbit blood, mixed with vinegar to prevent coagulation</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            First, marinate the meat: In a large bowl, marinate the chicken or rabbit pieces with red wine, salt, and pepper. Let it sit for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight, in the refrigerator.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Next, cook the meat: In a large pot, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, and bay leaf, and saut√© until the onion is translucent. Add the marinated meat pieces and cook until browned on all sides.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Add the rice: Once the meat is browned, add the rice to the pot and stir to coat the rice with the oil and meat juices.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Add water and simmer: Pour in enough water to cover the rice and meat, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer until the rice is cooked and tender, about 20 minutes.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Incorporate the blood: Slowly pour the blood mixture into the pot, stirring constantly to ensure it is well combined with the rice and meat. Continue to cook on low heat for an additional 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Final touches: Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.
        </li><br>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
        Note: Garnish with fresh parsley before serving. Arroz de Cabidela is often served with a green salad and pairs well with a robust red wine.
