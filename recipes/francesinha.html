            First, let's start the recipe with the sauce: peel the onion and garlic, chop them coarsely, and put them in a pot. Meanwhile, add olive oil, bay leaf, paprika, and parsley. Place on the stove and let it sauté for 10 minutes. Add the ripe tomato or tomato pulp, fat trimmings or beef bouillon, beverages, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and let it boil. Then, dissolve the cornstarch in a bit of milk to cut the acidity and thicken the sauce. Add this mixture to the pot slowly while stirring continuously. Adjust the salt, season with piri-piri, and stir. Next, strain through a fine-mesh sieve and return to low heat to warm up.

            Second, assemble the Francesinha: On a slightly toasted slice of bread, place the ham, steak, a layer of previously grilled linguiça and sausage, and finally another slice of bread.
