    <h3>Steps:</h3>

            First, let's prepare the cod: Soak the salted cod in water for 24-48 hours, changing the water several times to remove the excess salt. After soaking, shred the cod into small pieces.

            Second, cook the potatoes: Boil the diced potatoes in salted water until tender. Drain and set aside.

        <li>
            Next, prepare the sauce: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and minced garlic, cooking until the onions are translucent. Add the shredded cod and cook for a few minutes until heated through.

        <li>
            Add the cream and milk to the skillet, stirring to combine. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Let it simmer for a few minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Combine the potatoes and cod mixture: In a large baking dish, spread the cooked potatoes evenly. Pour the cod and cream mixture over the potatoes, mixing gently to combine.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Finally, bake the dish: Preheat the oven to 200°C (392°F). Place the baking dish in the oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly. Remove from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.
        </li><br>
    </ol>

        Note: Garnish with chopped parsley before serving. Bacalhau com Natas pairs well with a green salad and a glass of white wine.
